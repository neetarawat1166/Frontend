    <td><p><b>Banasthali Vidyapith</b> is a fully residential women's higher education institute which offers an integrated system extending from the primary to the Ph.D. level.<br><br>It was on October 6, 1935 that Smt. Ratan Shastri and Pandit Hiralal Shastri founded Banasthali to fill up the vacuum caused by the sudden death of their highly talented and promising daughter Shantabai.<br>They had high expectations that she would work for women's cause when she would grow up. But  destiny  ordained  otherwise.
     Thus, Banasthali  owes its existence neither to the zeal of an educationist, nor to that of a social reformer. <br>It is also not the creation of a Philanthropist's purse. It has arisen like the fabled phoenix from the ashes of a blossoming flower Shantabai.</p>
